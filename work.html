                <p>
                    This project was to create a website that would be used as an online portfolio to showcase other
                    projects I completed throughout my courses at Career Foundry.
                    It was to be built using HTML/CSS and introduce SVG images as well as customizing/animating the SVG.
                    I learned about and used a Kanban board to manage and track my goals throughout the portfolio
                    development project as well.

                    The project consists of two parts: a backend API application which implements a RESTful API and a
                    client frontend that accesses it. The application deals with movies and users can register and login
                    to their account to view a movie list, view movie details, add/remove movies from a list of
                    favorites, update account information and delete their account if desired.

                <p>
                    This project was aimed at building a serverless, progressive web application with React
                    using a test-driven development approach. The application uses the Google Calendar API
                    to fetch upcoming events. Google OAuthentication used to gain authorization for the application.
                    Domains registered with Google for improved search results for Meet application and GitHub
                    repository.

                <p>
                    This project involved building a native chat application for mobile devices using React Native. The
                    application allows users to send text chats, images and share their location. Chat history
                    will be preserved in an online database as well as on the device for limited
                    offline use.

                <p>
                    This project was to rewrite the Matinee application (React) in Angular and make use of Angular
                    Material in the project. The backend API application would remain the same as the React Matinee
                    application and the Angular Matinee would make use of it.

                <p>
                    Application built with Angular, Angular Material, TypeScript. A Kanban board on Trello was used
                    and cards tracked tasks to complete for components, documentation and portfolio updates for this
                    project.
