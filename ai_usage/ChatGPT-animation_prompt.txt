You can achieve the effect of making a grid item grow slightly and flash on hover using CSS3 animations. Here's how you can do it:




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Grid Item Hover Transition</title>
<style>
    .grid {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
        gap: 20px;
    }

    .grid-item {
        width: 100%;
        height: 200px;
        background-color: #ddd;
        transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
    }

    .grid-item:hover {
        transform: scale(1.05);
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
        animation: flash 1s infinite alternate;
    }

    @keyframes flash {
        0% {
            opacity: 1;
        }
        100% {
            opacity: 0;
        }
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid-item"></div>
    <div class="grid-item"></div>
    <div class="grid-item"></div>
    <div class="grid-item"></div>
</div>

</body>
</html>




In this code:

The grid items have a transition on the transform property to make them grow slightly (scale(1.05)) on hover.
Additionally, a box-shadow is added to give a flashing effect when hovering.
The flash animation is defined using @keyframes, which changes the opacity of the grid item from 1 to 0 and back to 1. This animation is applied infinitely (infinite) and alternates between the start and end states.
You can adjust the animation duration, timing function, and other properties to fit your desired effect.
